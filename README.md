# Conditional URL Advertisements

Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org). 

## Description
This plugin allows you to redirect all shortlinks through a link monetizer. 

Currently, the following shorteners are supported:
  * [AdFly](https://adf.ly/?id=2777408), trigger: `a/`
  * [AdFoc.us](http://adfoc.us/?refid=287608), trigger `f/`
  * [CoinURL](https://coinurl.com/index.php?ref=5e7f93ae61a2bf890b40bd470929998b), trigger `c/`

Going to a shorturl with a trigger before it will automatically forward the url through the selected service (ex *sho.rt/a/test*). If it recognizes a trigger but there is no associated service it will use adfly.

If you have another sevice you want supported, make a ticket for it!
