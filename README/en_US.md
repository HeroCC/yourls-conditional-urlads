# Conditional URL Advertisements

Plugin for [YOURLS](http://yourls.org). 

## Description
This plugin allows you to redirect all shortlinks through a link monetizer. 

Currently, the following shorteners are supported:
  * [AdFly](https://join-adf.ly/21969401), trigger: `a/`
  * [AdFoc.us](https://adfoc.us/?refid=788613), trigger `f/`
  * [ouo.io](https://ouo.io/ref/MpFHTzmv), trigger `o/`

Going to a shorturl with a trigger before it will automatically forward the url through the selected service (ex *sho.rt/a/test*). If it recognizes a trigger but there is no associated service it will not monetize the link.

If you have another sevice you want supported, make a ticket for it!

3. Edit the plugin's user config (inside `user-config.php`) to suit your needs
4. Go to the Plugins administration page and activate the plugin
5. Test your shortlinks with each activated service
6. If everything works, celebrate!
